<!-- 👨‍💻 Just a humble README file... or is it? -->

![yoo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/548c4b97-013d-4271-bde4-2c55b89c026b)

# 👋 Oh hey, didn’t see you there...

## I'm **Soham**, and this README? Yeah, it's basically my superhero origin story — minus the radioactive spiders and tragic backstory.

## 🧠 Who Dis?

- 🎓 Final Year AI & DS Student (they grow up so fast 😢)
- 🧬 I vibe with:
  - Making machines “think” (AI/ML)
  - Sharing data *responsibly* (because I’m not a data villain)
  - Staring at blurry images until they become crowd counts (CV)
  - Reading binary like bedtime stories (Cybersecurity 🧑‍💻)
  - Architecting privacy-first systems that even your paranoid uncle would trust

### 🎓 School of Hard (Machine) Learning
- **K. K. Wagh Institute of Engineering Education & Research**
- Major: Artificial Intelligence & Data Science (Yeah, I know, sounds fancy)

---

## 🧰 My Toolbox (aka what I threaten bugs with)

- **Backend Biceps:** Python, FastAPI, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **ML Muscles:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Transformers
- **Hacker Kit™:** ClamAV, Kali Linux, OpenRefine, Tesseract
- **Bonus Moves:** AES-256, SHA-256, Docker kung-fu, Tokenization magic ✨

## 🚀 Featured Projects (a.k.a. "Look Ma, I did a thing!")

### 🧠 [Crowd Counting using CSRNet](https://github.com/thesoham2203)
> When “How many people are here?” becomes a deep learning question.  
Used CSRNet with dilated convs to estimate crowd density maps. Trained on images with more people than my inbox after exam week.

### 🧏‍♂️ [Indian Sign Language Recognition](https://github.com/thesoham2203)
> Making hands talk — literally.  
A CV-based ISL recognizer that turns signs into text/speech. Making conversations more inclusive, one gesture at a time.

## 🎯 Currently Hacking Away At...

🧠 **RE-DACT**  
> A redaction tool so secure, even the NSA might blush.  
Built with FastAPI, PyMuPDF, OCR, GANs, Ethereum & Tauri. Scrubbing PDFs, images, and videos like your chat history before mom checks your phone.

🛡️ **PolicyVault Nexus**  
> A privacy-first, RBI-compliant data sharing stack — because “oops” isn’t a valid excuse under DPDP.  
Implements FF3-1 tokenization, consent enforcement, zero-persistence APIs, and in-memory magic. FastAPI + Quarkus = 🔥

🧮 **Crowd Counting v2 (ResNet Edition)**  
> CSRNet retired. ResNet now does the counting. Regression model trained to spot humans like Terminator vision — but with PyTorch.

🛠️ **Placement Prep**  
> DSA. Aptitude. HR drills.  
Midnight oil? Consider it burned.

## 🪄 Fun & Other Shenanigans

- ✍️ I write poems about AI, time, and sometimes existential dread
- 💻 Breaking into VMs on Kali like it’s a CTF speedrun (purely ethical, mostly)
- 🎨 README ✨ aesthetics matter — yes, this is the drip section
